# 🌍 Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis Dashboard – Jabalpur

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) data across multiple monitoring stations in Jabalpur to identify pollution hotspots, temporal trends, and dominant pollutants.
Data was cleaned in Excel, validated using SQL, and visualized in Power BI to generate meaningful environmental insights.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Findings

* AQI levels showed noticeable spikes during several months, indicating periodic pollution buildup.
* **PM2.5** emerged as the dominant pollutant contributing to poor air quality days.
* One monitoring station consistently recorded the **highest average AQI**, making it the most critical pollution hotspot.
* Most AQI readings fell under **Moderate to Poor** categories, showing persistent air quality concerns.
* Several extreme AQI days crossed severe thresholds, highlighting short-term pollution spikes.
* AQI trends fluctuated across months rather than remaining consistently clean.
